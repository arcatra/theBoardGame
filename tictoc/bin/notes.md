The BoardBox accepts the type of: String, String. That is, the ID for each box is String.

- this is because i'm cheking if there are any valid xox matchets that is already considered or not.
- and for this i'm making a index string while checking for xox, and adding this to alreadyMatched. - this way we don't accidentally make any errors.
